## ✍️ What Went Wrong? A Simple Reflection on the Power of Clear Writing

### 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Meet the Writers: Layla and Rohan

At **GlobalView Media**, two team members — **Layla** and **Rohan** — were asked to write short update emails for a new internal project. Both are thoughtful and talented. Both had good intentions. But the results? A little surprising.

Layla’s email caused confusion. Rohan’s email got immediate praise. Let’s look at why — and how a few words can make all the difference.

### 📩 The Same Task, Two Different Emails

The project manager simply asked:

> “Send a short update on what you've done so far, and what’s coming next.”

Layla wrote:

> *“Hi team, just wanted to give a quick update. Have done some tasks, and more will be done soon. Let me know if you need anything.”*

Rohan wrote:

> *“Hi team, I completed the research for Phase 1 and drafted the outline for the video script. Next up: reviewing with the design team by Friday. Let me know if you’d like to join that session.”*

Both were short. Both polite. But one gave clarity. The other… left people guessing.

### 🧩 What Caused the Confusion?

Let’s reflect on **Layla’s email**. What felt vague?

* **“Some tasks”** — which ones?
* **“More will be done soon”** — when? by who?
* **“Let me know if you need anything”** — anything about what?

Now, Layla didn’t write anything *wrong*. But her message lacked clear actions, timing, and ownership — which left her colleagues unsure.

### 🌟 Why Rohan’s Writing Worked

Now take a closer look at **Rohan’s version**:

* He named the work done: **“research for Phase 1,”**
* He showed progress: **“drafted the outline”**
* He added a time cue: **“by Friday”**
* He offered collaboration clearly: **“join that session”**

It wasn’t long. It wasn’t fancy. It was simply **clear**. That’s what made it strong.

### 💬 Tiny Language Choices, Big Impact

So what did we learn?

* Saying **“some tasks”** makes people ask follow-up questions.
* Saying **“Phase 1 research completed”** lets people nod and move forward.
* Polite phrases like “just wanted to” or “quick update” sound unsure, even when you’ve done great work.

When you write, every word — even a short one — sends a signal. If you choose words with **clarity and direction**, people trust your message more. They see your thinking more clearly.

### 🔍 What Could Have Been Done Differently?

If Layla could rewind, here’s what she might write now:

> *“Hi team, I’ve finished drafting our content calendar and updated the project tracker. Next step: scheduling the client review call by Wednesday. Let me know if you'd like to help prep questions.”*

It’s still her voice. Still polite. But now it feels **complete**, **confident**, and **helpful**.

### 📓 Reflection from the Characters

That Friday, Layla and Rohan had a quick chat over coffee.

> **Layla**: “I thought I was being efficient… but I guess I was too vague.”
> **Rohan**: “You were being polite. You just didn’t say what you *actually did*.”
> **Layla** (laughing): “Next time, I’m skipping ‘just wanted to’ — and saying what matters.”

---

### 🌱 Final Thought

You don’t need fancy vocabulary to write powerfully. You just need **clarity, structure, and intent**.

Next time you send a short update, ask yourself:

* Did I say what I *did*?
* Did I say what’s *next*?
* Can someone *act* on this, or will they be confused?

Because in writing — **being clear is being kind**.
